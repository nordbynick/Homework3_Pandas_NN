Homework #3 Submission

Note: The answers to my questions are also imbedded in my code file.

Questions Identified:
> Which portfolios are riskier than the S&P500? Riskier portfolios are Algo2, Berkshire, and Tiger

> Do the algorithmic strategies outperform the S&P500 & Whale strategies? Algo1 is the best performing overall strategy. Algo2 also performs more in line with the other portfolios.

> How does the custom portfolio do? The custom portfolio doesn't have the best Sharpe Ratio, given it is more volatile than the SP500, and the returns aren't vastly better; although, it does outperform the market. I would still invest in Algo1 above all else.
